# Airline_Recommendation_System

To alleviate the problem of information overload, which has become a possible problem
for many internet users, it is necessary to filter, prioritize, and efficiently communicate critical
information on the Internet, where the number of alternatives is overwhelming. Recommender
systems solve this problem by looking through a massive amount of dynamically produced data to
provide personalized content and services. For example, when a passenger wants to travel, no site
takes user preferences and recommends the flight based on his criteria. Therefore, a friendly
personalized flight recommendation system is necessary, which can give importance to user
preference and recommend the flight to choose from the options and travel according to his needs.
We have used different techniques like collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid
filtering to generate the appropriate results.
