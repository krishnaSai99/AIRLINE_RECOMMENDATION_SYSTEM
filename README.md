# Personalized Airline Recommendation System  

## Overview  
This project tackles the problem of **information overload** by providing a **personalized Airline recommendation system** that prioritizes user preferences. The system uses advanced recommender techniques to suggest flights tailored to individual needs, enhancing the user experience and enabling efficient decision-making in a crowded digital landscape.  

## Features  
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Analyzes user behavior and preferences to recommend flights based on patterns from similar users.  
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Considers attributes of flights to match user-defined criteria.  
- **Hybrid Filtering**: Combines collaborative and content-based approaches for more accurate recommendations.  

## Objectives  
- Streamline the process of flight selection for users with diverse needs.  
- Provide tailored recommendations by integrating **machine learning** and **data-driven decision-making**.  
- Address challenges in dynamic data processing for personalized service.  

## How It Works  
1. Gathers and processes user preferences (e.g., budget, destination, timing, User country, Age group, Feature preference, and Cabin choice).  
2. Applies filtering techniques to analyze flight data and user interactions.  
3. Generates recommendations that align with user-defined parameters.
